# Calculator Application

This project is a simple **React Native** application developed using **TypeScript**. It's a great way to explore and get familiar with React Native and TypeScript. This is the first of many React Native projects in this repository, and it is designed for anyone who wants to dive into mobile app development with React Native.

Feel free to clone the repo and make any changes or improvements as needed. Contributions are welcome!

## Project Overview

- **Framework**: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **CLI Tool**: Bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Features

- Simple calculator functionality.
- Cross-platform support (iOS & Android).
- Built with React Native's modern TypeScript support.

## Installation and Running the App

To get the app up and running on your device, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
cd calculator-app

```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Bundler

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. To start it, run the following command in the root of your project directory:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Metro Bundler will start and keep running in a terminal window. Keep it open while working with your app.

## Step 4: Run the Application on Your Device

With Metro running in a separate terminal, open a new terminal window from the root of your project to launch your app on an Android or iOS emulator.

### For Android

Ensure that an Android emulator is running, or connect a physical device with debugging enabled.

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For IOS

Make sure you have Xcode and an iOS simulator set up, or connect an iPhone for testing.

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
